            Bonus and Promotions Policy

          <p>
            The Company offers several attractive Bonus programs to its new and
            existing Clients, who have activated their trading account. Bonuses
            and/or financial awards and/or promotions (“Bonuses”) rewarded to
            Clients are part of the Company’s promotions program. These Bonuses
            have limited time offers and their conditions can be subject to
            change upon written notice given to the Clients on the modifications
            to substantial parts of the conditions. Prior to accepting any
            Bonuses offer, Clients will be given the opportunity to consider the
            terms and conditions associated with each Bonus scheme in order to
            fully understand how the scheme works as well as its T & C and
            provide their consent in regard to the adoption of any alterations.
            In case the client will not provide the Company with any feedback or
            advice to the contrary within the period of seven (7) days, the
            Company shall consider that the client consents and/or accepts the
            content of the amendment.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            The Clients are not required to accept any Bonuses offered by the
            Company; all Bonuses are optional. The Clients may choose not to
            accept a Bonus. In these circumstances, the Clients will not be
            bound to the terms relating to the Bonus. By accepting the Bonuses
            offered, the Clients will be bound by the guidelines, provisions and
            terms of the Bonus programs, provided that they have fully
            understood and agreed with the terms and conditions of this
            agreement.
          </p>
          <br />

          <p>
            The different Bonus programs and promotions are given at random
            events and will be added to the clients trading account in one of
            the following forms:
          </p>
          <br />

          <p>
            Pending bonus – bonus will be added to the traders ‘pending bonus’
            box and will be added to the actual account balance once certain
            amounts of trade have been carried out. The bonus may not be traded
            unless the specific volume is met according to the specific Bonus
            scheme entered into.
          </p>
          <br />

          <p>
            To track the trader’s volume and locate the bonus and its relevant
            status, the trader is hereby invited to check the Reports section on
            the main page once logged in. To do so, the trader may click the
            “Reports” button, in the upper right hand corner of the page, then
            in the “transactions” tab, the volume will appear in addition to the
            bonus reports. The trader has the ability to view the bonus report,
            which tracks the volume on a day-to-day basis.
          </p>
          <br />

          <p>
            The required volume to be reached in order to withdraw a bonus is
            calculated by using the bonus amount multiplied by a rate between
            40-50. The trading volume is a calculation of the trader’s trades,
            regardless of the outcome. In a sense, it is a monitor of the
            trader’s trading activity.
          </p>
          <br />

          <p>
            For example: you are granted a pending welcome bonus of 25% on your
            deposit. If you deposited $300, your pending bonus is $75. The
            volume requirement is 40 times $75, equaling $3,000. Once you trade
            a volume of $3,000, the $75 will be released into your balance and
            available for any given needs.
          </p>
          <br />

          <p>
            It is here mentioned that the acceptance and reception of the bonus
            might come as overwhelming due to the extent of the bonus that
            could, sometimes, exceedingly improve the state of the trader’s
            account. In some instances, traders tend to misuse their bonus’ good
            fortune and spend it all at once. Therefore, we ask the trader to
            pay attention to the account’s status and urge the trader to invest
            the bonus amount with caution and responsibility.
          </p>
          <br />

          <p>All of the Company’s additions to the bonus terms are final.</p>
          <br />

          <p>
            The Clients are hereby invited to utilize the Company’s bonus in a
            rightful and justified manner, according to the terms and conditions
            of this agreement. The Company reserves the right to cancel and even
            close the trader’s account if it suspects any form of abuse or
            wrongdoing of the bonus by the trader, which include reasons as
            stated in section 23.
          </p>
          <br />

          <p>
            The Company is to single-mindedly conclude and decide upon whether
            clients have abused and/or misused its platform and/or its bonuses.
          </p>
          <br />

            liquidity available through streaming, tradable prices for most of
            the financial instruments offered on the trading platform. Due to
            the highly automated nature of delivering these streaming prices,

            exploiting such misquotations or act in bad faith (commonly known as
            ‘sniping’), the Company will consider this behaviour unacceptable.
            If, at its sole discretion and in good faith, the Company determines
            that any Client or their representative is taking advantage of,

          </p>
          <br />

          <h4>Prohibited and Unlawful Trading Techniques</h4>
          <p>
            Trading strategies aimed at exploiting price errors, off-market
            prices, or internet delays — commonly known as ‘arbitrage’,
            ‘sniping’, or ‘scalping’ (collectively, “Arbitrage”) — are
            incompatible with an OTC market where Clients trade directly with
            the Principal. The Company reserves the right to prohibit abusive
            exploitation of Arbitrage on its Online Trading Facility and/or in
            connection with its services.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h4>Changes in Market Conditions</h4>
          <p>
            The Company is under no obligation to advise Clients on appropriate
            actions following changes in Market Conditions or otherwise. Clients
            acknowledge that trading in Over-The-Counter (OTC) Contracts for
            Differences (CFDs) is highly speculative and volatile. Following
            execution of any transaction, Clients bear sole responsibility for
            maintaining timely contact with the Company, monitoring open
            positions, and providing further instructions as needed.

          <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">TERMINATION</h2>
          <p>
            Clients may terminate this Agreement by providing the Company with
            at least seven (7) days’ written notice specifying the termination
            date, ensuring all open positions are closed by that date. The
            Company may also terminate this Agreement with seven (7) days’
            written notice. The Company reserves the right to terminate the
            Agreement immediately without notice in cases including, but not
            limited to:
            <ul>
              <li>Death of the Client;</li>
              <li>Client bankruptcy or winding-up proceedings;</li>
              <li>Regulatory authority or body mandates termination;</li>
              <li>
                Material breach of Agreement preventing its implementation;
              </li>
              <li>Violation of applicable laws or regulations;</li>
              <li>Involvement in any form of fraud;</li>
              <li>Occurrence of an Event of Default as defined herein.</li>
            </ul>
            <br />
            Termination does not affect accrued rights, outstanding commitments,
            or provisions intended to survive termination. Upon termination,
            Clients remain liable for:
            <ul>
              <li>Any pending fees or amounts owed to the Company;</li>
              <li>Charges or expenses incurred due to termination;</li>
              <li>Damages arising during settlement of obligations.</li>
            </ul>
            The Company reserves the right to reverse prior transactions that
            jeopardize its or its clients’ interests before termination.

            ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF RISKS
          </h2>
          <p>
            Clients acknowledge that market conditions and fluctuations may
            increase, decrease, or reduce the value of Financial Instruments to
            zero. The Company’s information does not guarantee performance.
            Clients understand and accept the significant risks of losses and
            damages associated with investing via the Company’s platform and
            willingly assume such risks. Clients confirm they have read,
            understood, and accept that:
            <ul>
              <li>Past performance is not indicative of future results;</li>
              <li>
                Currency fluctuations may adversely affect investments
                denominated in foreign currencies;
              </li>
              <li>
                Clients may lose all invested funds and must only invest what
                they can afford to lose, inclusive of any fees or commissions.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <br />
            The maximum loss is limited to the amount paid to the Company,
            including rolling fees for day trades. Each financial contract is an
            individual, non-transferable agreement between the Client and the
            Company.
